# Stoneshard - Pelt Durability

## Description

This mod allows you to customize how damage types interact with pelts using an ini file. 
For instance you can nullify fire damages dealt to pelt if you want to skin animals while using pyromancy.

To do this, you can modify the value `Fire (%)` found in `Setting/Mod`, with `0` meaning that damage will deal no damages to pelt (like Slashing weapons in vanilla) and the more you increase that value, the more damage it will deal to pelt.

## Installation

Since this mod was made through MSL, you first need to install it and then patching the game with it.
You can follow the official [installation guide](https://modshardteam.github.io/ModShardLauncher/guides/how-to-play-mod.html) on the MSL documentation.

A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J0oJYGi38E&t=13s&ab_channel=Nylux) was made by Nylux to show how to install Neoconsole, if you prefer a video guide.

### Installing MSL

- Download the latest release of [MSL](https://modshardteam.github.io/ModShardLauncher).
- Unzip it.
- (Optional) Rename the data.win file in the Stoneshard folder with an other name so you'll have a backup if something went wrong.

### Using MSL

- Download the latest `.zip` of [Stoneshard - Pelt Durability](https://github.com/remyCases/Stoneshard-PeltDurability/releases).
- Unzip it, you should have one file.
- Move the `PeltDurability.sml` in the `MSL/Mods` folder.
- Run `ModShardLauncher.exe`.
- Click on the anvil icon on the leftside.
- Click on the folder icon on the topside. A dialog box should pop up.
- Select the `.win` file in the Stoneshard folder (`data.win` if you didn't rename it).
- Enable the mod by checking the `Enable` box.
- Click the floppy disk icon on the topside. A dialog box should pop up.
- In this dialog box, create a new `.win` file and save (`data.win` if you didn't rename it).

You can now play the game with the modded version !
